# Offline Budget Tracker

## `Description`

* The offline budget tracker is an application I created so the user can conveniently balance their budget using my technology without internet connection. The user is able to record withdrawals and deposits which are then displayed on a line graph. Using local caching, I am able to save their transactions locally until they are able to connect to the internet again. When the user has an internet connection the data saved is sent to a mongoDB database.
